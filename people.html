                        <p>Jo’s research interests center around sustainability in the chemical industries through biotechnology. Following her MSc and PhD, she undertook postdoctoral research at the Manchester 
                           Institute of Biotechnology developing methods for the directed evolution of biocatalysts. She developed ultra-high throughput enzyme screening methodologies and bespoke variant 
                           library generation methods. In 2018, she moved to the University of St Andrews to work in the laboratory of Prof. Rebecca Goss on metabolic engineering for production of industrially 
                           important chemicals. In 2019, Jo moved to the University of Edinburgh to take up a BBSRC Discovery Fellowship focussing on the upcycling of plastic waste into high value chemicals in
                           the laboratory of Dr Stephen Wallace. In 2021, Jo was awarded a Chancellor’s Fellowship at the University of Edinburgh and set up her independent lab which draws on her

                        <p>Matt is very interested in sustainability and has spent a lot of his career trying to turn waste things into useful things, including decontaminating 
                           soil from old industrial sites and converting metal into medicines. Now in the Sadler Lab, he is developing a method of converting plastic bottles into 
                           high-value aromatic compounds such as vanillin. He is also involved in public engagement with science, and has even been part of an artistic interpretation 
                           of synthetic biology which was performed at the V&A in London.</p>

                        <p>Médoune gained his BSc in Biomedical Sciences and MSc in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Paris Descartes in France. He then moved to Stockholm, Sweden to complete his PhD in 
                           protein biotechnology at the Karolinska Institute where he developed a biological tool – inspired from how spiders make their silk – to address protein aggregation during heterologous expression. 
                           Keen on shifting his scientific focus towards synthetic biology, he joined the University of Bradford as a postdoctoral researcher. There, he worked on a project aiming to produce alkyl 
                           methacrylates from a lignocellulosic-based feedstock. He joined the Sadler Lab in 2023 to pursue his interest in sustainable biotechnologies. Here, he is helping to develop a bio-based route for 
                           upcycling PET plastics into industrially useful small molecules.</p>
